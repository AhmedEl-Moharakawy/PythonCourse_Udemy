Debugging:
==========
● Finding the bug with "2 Approaches"

● Printing approach:
  ==================
    ○ Like you do all the time.
    ○ Print statements where you suspect errors
    ○ Seems naive, but still strong one. In many big projects or some remote sessions is used
    ○ In real projects we also use loggers: logging several kind of information
■ Later with system issues we read logs guess where is the problem

● Debugger approach:
  ==================
    ○ Trace your code line by line. Very powerful if can be used

● Debugger: Program to help us debugging (from IDE or Console)
